# BulletHeaven + HordeSurvival Game

This is a small experimental project inspired by Vampire Survivor, with elements of BulletHeaven and HordeSurvival. The main goal was to explore and experiment with various aspects of game development, especially regarding mechanics and visual techniques.
## Project Goals

During the development of this project, I focused on experimenting and understanding the following key aspects:

- Top-Down View: Implementing a top-down perspective to provide a classic view for this type of game.
- Object Instantiation Area: Creating a system for dynamically spawning objects within the game, allowing enemies and objects to appear within the game area in a controlled manner.
- Render Layers: Studying render layers to allow visual effects like passing behind objects, such as trees, to create a sense of depth.
